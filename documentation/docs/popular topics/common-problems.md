## client.build is not a function

If you get an error in your console that says `TypeError: client.build is not a function`, this isn't the best error to get. (not saying any error is good)

Well at first, congratulations on picking the lucky card. This issue does not happen often.

Make sure your `config.js` file is completly filled up. If your config is completely filled out and it still causes the same error, Join our [support server](https://discord.gg/sbySMS7m3v) and report this problem.
